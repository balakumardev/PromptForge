**PromptForge gives your LLM the full context it needs with a single click.** No more copy-pasting multiple files, just right-click and paste for accurate, context-aware responses.

## üí• The Problem

When working with LLMs on code-related tasks, context is everything:

1. Copy a single file to ChatGPT
2. Get the response: *"I need to see the related classes to help you"*
3. Copy another file
4. Get: *"I still need to see how this interfaces with XYZ"*
5. Repeat until you've shared enough context

While IDE-integrated AI assistants are improving, they often have to make trade-offs about what context to include due to token limits and cost considerations. Sometimes you just want full control over what context is provided.

## ‚ú® The Solution: PromptForge

PromptForge is a simple yet powerful plugin that gives you complete control over the context you provide to LLMs:

- **One-Click Operation** - Right-click, select action, paste to LLM
- **Complete Context** - Automatically includes related files and dependencies
- **Full Control** - You decide how much context to include
- **No API Keys** - Works with any LLM you prefer
- **Task-Specific Prompts** - Optimized templates for different use cases

## üõ†Ô∏è What It Does

- **Gathers Related Files** - Automatically includes imports, dependencies, and implementations
- **Preserves Context** - Keeps the relationships between your files intact
- **Formats Prompts** - Creates optimized prompts for specific tasks:
    - üß™ **Generate Tests** - For new or modified code
    - üìù **Explain Code** - For understanding complex code
    - ‚ùì **Ask Questions** - For specific queries about your code
    - üîÑ **Make Changes** - For implementing specific changes
    - üìã **Copy with Context** - For custom prompts

### Generate Tests

Perfect for TDD or adding tests to existing code. Detects if you're working with a new file or making changes to an existing one.

### Explain Code

When you're staring at a complex piece of code thinking "what does this even do?" Let an LLM explain it with full context.

### Ask Questions

Have a specific question about your code? This action lets you ask it while providing all the context the LLM needs to answer correctly.

### Make Changes

Need to implement a feature or fix a bug? This action helps you get accurate suggestions based on your entire codebase's context.

### Copy with Context

For power users who want to craft their own prompts but still need the related files and context.
